Sphero BOLT.

1. One sensor could be found at a top right corner, it could detect light and respond with it to the right coding blocks.
2. Another corner could be found at the top left corner.
3. two more sensors could be found on the bottom.

From what i understand, These sensors can help measure light, speed, and can pinpoint to north with the world's magneticism.
Sensors can help us learn about more things and help guide us as we understand little by little as we learn, The sensor gathers data because we
use the program's built in coding blocks and we build them by tutorials or guides to help us. The light sensor detects ambient light from a
flashlight, phone light or lightbulbs. it has a value called "Lux", collecting lights as protons.
These sensors can help with certain activities like tug of war game, the hot potato game and etc... 
BOLT helps us learn more about coding and helps us understand its script, helping us to know how to code in computers and progress further.

We can solve issues with making our journals is by reading or listening to the instructons carefully,
therefore; we can make our journals correctly and allowing the bot to be able to check our journals.

To run the code cleanly, you must check and watch out for warnings and errors to make sure the code runs smoothly. possible things can happen to the coding is causing the game to crash, experience errors and glitch. The important thing to make sure your code runs smoothly and stay all clean is to pay attention to what you're doing and always check for errors and warnings. that way would allow us to make a good habit out of it and always be able to run codes smoothly.

**Digital Artist, Game designer.**
 I have chose the path to become a Digital Artist to create animations and art, make content on social media apps and do art/animation commissions. It doesn't sound much but it takes a lot of time to do those kinds of things, I have a future dedicating to creating my own studio, production and making an animation series. I have much more to think about when I get all of the resources I need as a Digital Artist. I have a dream to design a game and design characters for it as well, Designing a game would be a dream come true as I am a creative person and think of the ideas I have in mind for my project. In order to do all of this, I would need to learn the basics of coding in computer science. This would be helpful for me as I can code for my own game and know when there's an error or any bug fixing issues, making the game and coding run smoothly. As well as needing a computer to be creating a game in either Unity or any other program, Blender would be useful for me if I ever need to make 3D characters, models, projects and etc... I will learn and study all over again for these goals, able to make a creative project and achieve my goal. These opportunities can allow me to improve on my art, coding language and able to create a game for others to come try, play and enjoy the experience. This job aligns with my interests and goals because computer science allows me to learn coding and step by step coding language on each website, app and program. Once I achieved that goal, I will now be happy and continue doing what I worked for and repeat that whole step all over again. One once told me, "You learn more, You repeat learning all over again.".

Coding helps you improve on certain coding programs like Java, Python and all of the other programs. You'll be able to identify errors, bugs and issues...etc.
