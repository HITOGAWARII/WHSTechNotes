Sphero BOLT.

1. One sensor could be found at a top right corner, it could detect light and respond with it to the right coding blocks.
2. Another corner could be found at the top left corner.
3. two more sensors could be found on the bottom.

From what i understand, These sensors can help measure light, speed,and can pinpoint to north with the world's magneticism.
Sensors can help us learn about more things and help guide us as we understand little by little as we learn, The sensor gathers data because we
use the program's built in coding blocks and we build them by tutorials or guides to help us. The light sensor detects ambient light from a
flashlight, phone light or lightbulbs. it has a value called "Lux", collecting lights as protons.
These sensors can help with certain activities like tug of war game, the hot potato game and etc... 
BOLT helps us learn more about coding and helps us understand its script, helping us to know how to code in computers and progress further.

We can solve issues with making our journals is by reading or listening to the instructons carefully,
therefore; we can make our journals correctly and allowing the bot to be able to check our journals.

To run the code cleanly, you must check and watch out for warnings and errors to make sure the code runs smoothly. possible things can happen to the coding is causing the game to crash, experience errors and glitch. The important thing to make sure your code runs smoothly and stay all clean is to pay attention to what you're doing and always check for errors and warnings. that way would allow us to make a good habit out of it and always be able to run codes smoothly.

**Digital Artist, Game designer.**
 I have chose the path to become a Digital Artist to create animations and art, make content on social media apps and do art/animation commissions. It doesn't sound much but it takes a lot of time to do those kinds of things, I have a future dedicating to creating my own studio, production and making an animation series. I have much more to think about when I get all of the resources I need as a Digital Artist. I have a dream to design a game and design characters for it as well, Designing a game would be a dream come true as I am a creative person and think of the ideas I have in mind for my project. In order to do all of this, I would need to learn the basics of coding in computer science. This would be helpful for me as I can code for my own game and know when there's an error or any bug fixing issues, making the game and coding run smoothly. As well as needing a computer to be creating a game in either Unity or any other program, Blender would be useful for me if I ever need to make 3D characters, models, projects and etc... I will learn and study all over again for these goals, able to make a creative project and achieve my goal. These opportunities can allow me to improve on my art, coding language and able to create a game for others to come try, play and enjoy the experience. This job aligns with my interests and goals because computer science allows me to learn coding and step by step coding language on each website, app and program. Once I achieved that goal, I will now be happy and continue doing what I worked for and repeat that whole step all over again. One once told me, "You learn more, You repeat learning all over again.".

Coding helps you improve on certain coding programs like Java, Python and all of the other programs. You'll be able to identify errors, bugs and issues...etc.

The importance of protecting our personal information is to protect people from doing such harmful things, hacking into our social medias, getting hold of our private files, photos and etc...
to ensure that your information does not get too overshared, you share little information about yourself; not sharing too detailed as people can take ahold of that information and try something sketchy. you can share your age, carreer and what you do best in your carreer. anything else has to be shared with its own limit.
Once, I have overshared my personal information; I have gotten harrassed for that information online, which is why I do not share information about myself unless asked. That gave me a lesson that I should not share my information deeply online.
I try to balance out working spaces and my personal information by creating a profile for myself when I am in public, at work and etc. At work, I can share information about things such as carreers, businesses, companiee and such others.
The way to protect your private information is to share less about yourself, be careful with the words you use online and on social medias and never share anything about where you live unless it's sharing your information about your business you work at.

The video game designing/coding program is an event where developers who specializes in coding in games such as Minecraft, Horror games, Online mulitplayer games, dress up games and etc... This game programming design is something we learn in computer science, coding languages. coding helps us create wonderful things, make websties, applications, games, amazing creations we know of that is on the internet.
The game designing program helps you create unique games and make things move, well, not just move but function perfectly if tweaked its errors, bugs and etc... learning these things in computer science classes allow you to do these things, it's amazing how technology can evolve.

This week we are celebrating Thanksgiving day which was to celebrate the harvest and other blessings. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people. A reason that led to the first thanksgiving was followed by a successful harvest in the autumn of 1621, the colonists decided to celebrate with a three-day festive of prayer. The 53 surviving are said to have eaten with 90 indigenous people in what became known as the first Thanksgiving.

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is reshaping industries and everyday life in profound ways. Recent developments in AI, especially in generative AI and its applications, are gaining significant attention. Generative AI can create new content, such as text, images, and even music, by learning patterns from existing data. This capability is being utilized across multiple sectors, including marketing, healthcare, and entertainment. With systems like GPT-4 set to revolutionize content generation, the potential for creativity and efficiency in various fields is unlimited. Generative AI's ability to automate content creation could lead to enhanced productivity in the workplace. Individuals can expect to see more personalized experiences in their daily lives, as AI systems will analyze user preferences to deliver tailored services and products. For instance, in the education sector, AI can provide personalized learning experiences, adapting materials to suit the learning pace and style of each student. Meanwhile, in healthcare, generative AI could support telemedicine by generating real-time data analysis, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and streamlining patient care processes.

I am not looking forward to winter break. Why? 'Cause I don't have my phone! >:( My winter break is to "Draw" told by my guardians themselves, I cannot think of anything to draw because of artblock. I feel exhausted working and having to work at home again!!
