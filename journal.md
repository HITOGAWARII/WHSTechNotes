Sphero BOLT.

1. One sensor could be found at a top right corner, it could detect light and respond with it to the right coding blocks.
2. Another corner could be found at the top left corner.
3. two more sensors could be found on the bottom.

From what i understand, These sensors can help measure light, speed,and can pinpoint to north with the world's magneticism.
Sensors can help us learn about more things and help guide us as we understand little by little as we learn, The sensor gathers data because we
use the program's built in coding blocks and we build them by tutorials or guides to help us. The light sensor detects ambient light from a
flashlight, phone light or lightbulbs. it has a value called "Lux", collecting lights as protons.
These sensors can help with certain activities like tug of war game, the hot potato game and etc... 
BOLT helps us learn more about coding and helps us understand its script, helping us to know how to code in computers and progress further.

**Digital Artist, Game designer.**
 I have chose the path to become a Digital Artist to create animations and art, make content on social media apps and do art/animation commissions. It doesn't sound much but it takes a lot of time to do those kinds of things, I have a future dedicating to creating my own studio, production and making an animation series. I have much more to think about when I get all of the resources I need as a Digital Artist. I have a dream to design a game and design characters for it as well, Designing a game would be a dream come true as I am a creative person and think of the ideas I have in mind for my project. In order to do all of this, I would need to learn the basics of coding in computer science. This would be helpful for me as I can code for my own game and know when there's an error or any bug fixing issues, making the game and coding run smoothly. As well as needing a computer to be creating a game in either Unity or any other program, Blender would be useful for me if I ever need to make 3D characters, models, projects and etc... I will learn and study all over again for these goals, able to make a creative project and achieve my goal. These opportunities can allow me to improve on my art, coding language and able to create a game for others to come try, play and enjoy the experience. This job aligns with my interests and goals because computer science allows me to learn coding and step by step coding language on each website, app and program. Once I achieved that goal, I will now be happy and continue doing what I worked for and repeat that whole step all over again. One once told me, "You learn more, You repeat learning all over again.".

The importance of protecting our personal information is to protect people from doing such harmful things, hacking into our social medias, getting hold of our private files, photos and etc...
to ensure that your information does not get too overshared, you share little information about yourself; not sharing too detailed as people can take ahold of that information and try something sketchy. you can share your age, carreer and what you do best in your carreer. anything else has to be shared with its own limit.
Once, I have overshared my personal information; I have gotten harrassed for that information online, which is why I do not share information about myself unless asked. That gave me a lesson that I should not share my information deeply online.
I try to balance out working spaces and my personal information by creating a profile for myself when I am in public, at work and etc. At work, I can share information about things such as carreers, businesses, companiee and such others.
The way to protect your private information is to share less about yourself, be careful with the words you use online and on social medias and never share anything about where you live unless it's sharing your information about your business you work at.

This week we are celebrating Thanksgiving day which was to celebrate the harvest and other blessings. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people. A reason that led to the first thanksgiving was followed by a successful harvest in the autumn of 1621, the colonists decided to celebrate with a three-day festive of prayer. The 53 surviving are said to have eaten with 90 indigenous people in what became known as the first Thanksgiving.

Government intervention can significantly impact technology companies and their users by imposing regulations that dictate how data is collected, stored, and shared. For instance, when a government raises national security concerns, it may lead to stricter compliance requirements, which can increase operational costs for companies. Users may experience changes in service availability or functionality, as companies may need to adapt to new regulations. This can create a tension between user experience and regulatory compliance, as companies strive to protect user data while also adhering to government mandates.
To address security concerns while continuing to operate globally, companies like TikTok could implement data localization strategies. This involves storing user data within the country where it is collected, thereby reducing the risk of foreign access and enhancing user trust. By establishing local data centers and ensuring that data handling complies with local laws, TikTok can alleviate some of the national security concerns raised by governments. ​This approach not only addresses privacy issues but also demonstrates a commitment to respecting local regulations, which can foster better relationships with users and regulators alike.

The application would include features such as real-time player performance tracking, play prediction models, and decision support systems. Real-time tracking would allow coaches to monitor player stats like speed, distance covered, and fatigue levels during the game. ​The play prediction model would utilize historical data and machine learning algorithms to suggest optimal plays based on the current game situation, opponent tendencies, and player performance metrics.​ Additionally, a decision support system would provide coaches with actionable insights, such as the likelihood of success for different plays based on real-time analytics.
To store player performance statistics, I would use a combination of dictionaries and databases. Dictionaries would allow for quick access to individual player stats, where each player's ID could be the key, and their performance metrics (e.g., yards gained, tackles made) would be the values. For more extensive data storage and retrieval, a relational database would be ideal, allowing for complex queries and data relationships, such as linking player stats to specific game situations. Algorithms like machine learning models could analyze this data to identify patterns and predict outcomes, while sorting and searching algorithms would help coaches quickly find relevant statistics during critical moments in the game.
