Sphero BOLT.

1. One sensor could be found at a top right corner, it could detect light and respond with it to the right coding blocks.
2. Another corner could be found at the top left corner.
3. two more sensors could be found on the bottom.

From what i understand, These sensors can help measure light, speed, and can pinpoint to north with the world's magneticism.
Sensors can help us learn about more things and help guide us as we understand little by little as we learn, The sensor gathers data because we
use the program's built in coding blocks and we build them by tutorials or guides to help us. The light sensor detects ambient light from a
flashlight, phone light or lightbulbs. it has a value called "Lux", collecting lights as protons.
These sensors can help with certain activities like tug of war game, the hot potato game and etc... 
BOLT helps us learn more about coding and helps us understand its script, helping us to know how to code in computers and progress further.
